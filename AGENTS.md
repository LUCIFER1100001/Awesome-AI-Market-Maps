- **[Exa Websets](https://websets.exa.ai/)** - AI-powered web search and content discovery
- **[Liner](https://getliner.com/)** - AI-enhanced reading and highlighting tool

### Content Processing & Automation
- **Python Scripts** - Custom automation for data extraction and processing
  - `extract_market_maps.py` - Extracts market map data from README to CSV
  - `generate_rss.py` - Generates RSS feeds from CSV data
  - `compare_readme_csv.py` - Compares README and CSV for consistency
  - `analyze_csv_issues.py` - Analyzes CSV data quality and issues

### Data Management
- **GitHub Actions** - Automated workflows for:
  - RSS feed generation
  - CSV updates
  - Data validation
- **Git Blame** - Tracks when market maps were added to the repository

## üîÑ Workflow Automation

### Data Extraction Pipeline
1. **Manual Curation** - Human-in-the-loop curation for quality and "taste"
2. **AI-Assisted Research** - AI tools help identify and validate new market maps
3. **Automated Processing** - Python scripts extract and structure data
4. **Quality Assurance** - Automated checks ensure data consistency
5. **Feed Generation** - RSS feeds automatically updated with new content

### Content Update Process
- README.md updated regularly with new market maps
