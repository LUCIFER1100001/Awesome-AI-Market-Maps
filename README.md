# Awesome-AI-Market-Maps
An Awesome List of Artificial Intelligence related market maps.

As these things go, this awesome list was inspired out of an ongoing personal frustration ‚Äî I have been searching for a frequently updated and well-resourced list of AI-related market maps. Since I couldn't find a comprehensive resource which met my needs, I decided to set something up for the greater community. 

METHODOLOGY  
The list is currently organized by quarter, to illustrate hot topics as they are discussed and how fast the industry is evolving. My current data collection workflow includes <a href="https://chatgpt.com/">ChatGPT</a>, <a href="https://websets.exa.ai/">Exa Websets</a>, and <a href="https://getliner.com/">Liner</a>. 

ADD OR UPDATE A MARKET MAP  
Named AI market maps, landscapes, blog posts with market maps, and related AI industry positioning (such as top XX lists) are fine.
